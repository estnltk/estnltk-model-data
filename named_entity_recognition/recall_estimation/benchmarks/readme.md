## Evaluation/estimation

The recall is estimated on a sample of named entity phrases, which was (randomly) drawn from a large corpus and manually corrected.  
The sample has been divided into subsamples (sub populations) based on different criteria (e.g. in the `amundsen_01` benchmark, based on the frequency/ambiguity of geographical terms appearing in subsamples).   
A tagger/model is evaluated on each of these subsamples and a weighted average of the results is the estimate of the recall. 

Recall estimations are based on: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_proportion_confidence_interval#Standard_error_of_a_proportion_estimation_when_using_weighted_data

This shows how to calculate the standard error of a binomial distribution when using weighted data. The 95% confidence interval is (sample_mean - 1.96 * standard_error, sample_mean + 1.96 * standard_error).
This standard error calculation assumes that the probability of each sample is equal to the sample mean. We could improve on that by using subsample means instead, not implemented here.
