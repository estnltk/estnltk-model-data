## Evaluation files

The evaluation files can be used for evaluating future model by replacing the necessary values at the beginning of the notebooks.

*benchmark_graph.ipynb* : uses the [leaderboard](../results/obl_1000_leaderboard.csv) file to create a graph with all the models.

NB! The value were added manually to the leaderboard file. In case new model data is added to the file then the markers assignment and colors have to be modified in the notebook.

The rest of the notebooks are for evaluating models.
