# Manually labelled morphological tags for selected words in Vabamorf format

There are many homonymous word forms in Estonian.
This creates a problem in morfological disambiguation that Vabamorf cannot resolve correctly.
The following dataset consists of targeted sample, which captures these ambiguities.
Note that only homonymous word form has manually curated tags.
The surrounding words are without annotations.
For further details, see [the code for generating the targeted sample](https://github.com/estnltk/estnltk-model-training/tree/main/morph_tagging/1000_sentences_with_homonymous_words).
